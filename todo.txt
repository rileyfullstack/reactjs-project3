Todo with ! before the line is a priority

Check with tsach about the liked card problem (when searching for a card, if it is liked, it will not show up unless the page is refreshed)
Make description box for edit/create card form bigger (Ask tsach about it)
! Make a readme file for the project (explain the project and how to run it) 
! delete all junk code from the project (all the commented code and sandbox file)
optional, if there is time - add a preview button to the edit/create card form
